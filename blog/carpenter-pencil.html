        <h2>What It Is</h2>
        <p>NicPro makes nice mechanical pencils that use round 2.8mm HB lead. They run $20 to $40 depending on the model. I wanted to see if I could make a printable version that works just as well &mdash; no springs, no screws, no hardware of any kind. Just the printed parts and a stick of lead.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/CarpenterPencil_1.jpg" alt="Mechanical pencil - side view on cutting mat">

        <p>The body has a textured grip section and a tapered front end. Twist the barrel to advance the lead. The whole mechanism is print-in-place &mdash; nothing to assemble beyond dropping the lead in.</p>

        <h2>Status Updates</h2>

              Started with the twist mechanism. The constraint of no hardware meant the threading and lead grip had to be built into the print geometry itself. Went through a few iterations on thread pitch and wall thickness.

              Working prototype. The lead holds well and the twist advance works. Still want to tighten up the feel &mdash; there's a bit of play in the mechanism that I'd like to dial out.

        <h2>What's Next</h2>
        <p>Refining the internal tolerances to get rid of the play in the twist mechanism. If I can get the feel as smooth as the NicPro originals, this was worth the effort. Goal is a pencil that costs nothing but filament and works just as well as one that costs $30.</p>
