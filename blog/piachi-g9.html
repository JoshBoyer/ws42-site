        <h2>What It Is</h2>
        <p>A fully 3D printed clone of the Piachi G9 utility knife. The form factor caught my eye as a pure engineering challenge &mdash; compact, satisfying mechanism, interesting geometry. I wanted to see if I could build the whole thing from a printer and a handful of screws.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/PiachiG9_5.jpg" alt="Piachi G9 clone - closed position">

        <p>The core is a gear system that pivots on an M3 screw. The gear has three positions with divots for alignment at each stop, and it drives a second M3 screw to control what the blade cover can do.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Back position</strong> &mdash; locks the blade cover shut. Safe for your pocket.</li>
          <li><strong>Middle position</strong> &mdash; opens the case just enough to swap the blade.</li>
          <li><strong>Right position</strong> &mdash; full open for quick deploy. Flick your wrist and the blade drops out, close the case to lock it in.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Under the hood there's a channel system that physically blocks the cover from opening when the gear is in the back position. Magnets handle blade alignment and help keep everything seated when closed.</p>

              First prints of the internal components on the A1 Mini. Getting the tolerances right for the gear to feel solid took a few rounds.

              Working prototype assembled. Blade extends, locks, and retracts across all three gear positions. Magnets are seated and alignment is good. Still refining the fit and feel before release.

        <h2>What's Next</h2>
        <p>Tightening up the tolerances on the gear action and doing a final round of test prints. Once I'm happy with the feel, this one goes on Makerworld.</p>
